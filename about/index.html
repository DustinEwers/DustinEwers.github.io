			My name is Dustin Ewers.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am a software developer located in Madison, Wisconsin. I primarily work with C# and ASP.NET, but I'm always looking for something interesting and new to try. I've been writing software professionally since 2006 and I've worked in a variety of industries: insurance, agriculture, and marketing. In addition to software, I'm interested in 3D printing, photography, psychology, economics, cooking, and science.
